According to the Belarusian delegation, the development of trade between the East and the West insists on the restoration of the water union. The volume of transportation on the route 'Dnepr - Vistula-Oder' can make about 3 million tons of cargo per year. Of particular importance, this route may have for the transportation of bulk goods (coal, ores, gravel, cement, metal products, etc.) towards Germany and the Scandinavian countries, as its length is 885 kilometers shorter than the traditional route of delivery by water the Danube-Main-Rhine. By the waterways of this transport connection, various tourist routes can also be laid."},

For the question from our country further answered the head of the department of foreign economic activity of the Ministry of Transport and Communications of Belarus Sergey Negrei."}
