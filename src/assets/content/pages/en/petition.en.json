New dams and dikes may appear on our rivers, their beds may be straightened and canalised, while their banks may be concreted."

It could bring irreparable injury to about 50 nature protected areas, which are the last refuge for endangered wildlife. Construction of the E40 waterway and increase of transportation, via huge sea-river vessels, will damage spawning places, affecting fish breeding."

Dredging operations and intensive cargo traffic will stir radioactive \nsludge on the river bed, causing it to move downstream, via the Prypiat and Dnieper, into the Kyiv Reservoir, which supplies millions of  Ukrainians with drinking water."

Even after its modernisation, the waterway won’t interest most shippers, as it cannot compete with railway or road transport routes. The investment won’t pay for itself, even in the long run, whilst its day-to-day operation will burden the budgets of the three countries. The cumulative effect of these and other factors will negatively impact on the national economies of Belarus, Poland and Ukraine."
