The developers of this project assume that the E40 will become a new trade route between the ports of the Baltic and Black seas, attract investments to the region and create new jobs. We, <a href='/#/ru/articles/public-opinion'> the environmental coalition </a>, believe that the project is ill-conceived, economically inefficient, and that the construction of the E40 will be a disaster both for the unique region of the Belarusian Polesie, as and for a number of valuable natural territories of Poland and Ukraine."

Except that from Warsaw to Brest it is not navigable, therefore, plans for the \"reconstruction\" of the E40 suggest building a bypass canal in Poland, six or seven dams and locks in Pripyat, as well as dredging on the entire route so that multitonnage \"river-sea\" vessels can follow the course of our rivers."

Feasibility study, (the most important project document, which specifies what, where and why will be built), was developed by a consortium led by the Maritime Institute in Gdansk. The work on the project was funded by the European Union within the Programme for Transboundary Cooperation between three countries. Now the initiators of the project are in search of funding for further research and work."

Moreover, Polesie has a lot of swamps that absorb 20 times more CO2 than forests and can be severely damaged due to the change in the hydrological regime of the region. It should be noted that the E40 waterway will affect <a href='/#/ru/articles/protected-areas'>some of the most valuable natural territories</a> in Belarus: Pripyat National Park, Polesie Radioecological Reserve, 11 republican sanctuaries and six local ones.
