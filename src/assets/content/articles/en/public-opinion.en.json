Polesye is a territory of global significance, thus we can protect it only by coming together: ecologists, inhabitants of Polesye (poleshuki), tourists, fishermen, hunters and other social groups."

For several months we studied the information on the project in detail, undertook a census of birds, undertook expeditions to the places, made assessments of economic efficiency of the project, analyzed and identified the potential environmental dangers, informed governmental establishments and admministrations of protected natural areas through which the E40 will be laid and whose opinion hadn't been yet considered.
