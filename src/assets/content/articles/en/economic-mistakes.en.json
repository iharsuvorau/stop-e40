The external costs, that is, the costs that third parties incur against their will while implementing the project must be also taken into account. However, generally the current document does not take them into account. And the developers claim that these costs cannot be estimated - but this is not true, in modern theory and practice of economy there are ways to assess them. If the benefits exceed the costs, then we can say that the project is useful for society and increases its welfare. This may be an argument for the object to be financed from public sources."

Very important for water transport is the way investment costs (one-time long-term investments) correlate with operational costs (aimed at maintaining current work). If annual operating costs are more than 1% of investment costs, then the project, as a rule, becomes unprofitable. In the case of the Oder project, this proportion was 3-5%. In continental Europe with severe winters and the navigation period limited to several months, such projects are likely to be systematically uncompetitive."

But in the case of our rivers, which for the most part are flat, shallow and heavily meandering, large-tonnage transit traffic does not make sense. Local and tourist transportation is possible."

It reads as follows: “...Waterways presented in the report are analysed in the model from optimistic viewpoint because they may seem to be the main ways geographically, while in practice shipping may be difficult or simply impossible (as in the case of E40). However, after serious recent investments in road, rail and air infrastructure, it is time to draw attention to the waterways...”.
