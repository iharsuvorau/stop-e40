Developers of the project consider that E40 will become a new commercial highway connecting harbours of Baltic and Black Seas, will attract investment to the region and will create new jobs. We are an environmental coalition, we think that this project is maladapted, doesn't make economic sense and that construction of E40 will become a catastrophy for the unique region of Bearusian Plesye as well as the natural territories of Poland and Ukraine."
