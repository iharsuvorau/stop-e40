tabs-0/paragraphs-0/text,"Stop E40 is a public campaign against construction of the E40 waterway which is going to be laid through rivers of Poland, Belarus and Ukraine. Developers of the project consider that E40 will become a new commercial highway connecting harbours of Baltic and Black Seas, will attract investment to the region and will create new jobs. We are an environmental coalition, we think that this project is maladapted, doesn't make economic sense and that construction of E40 will become a catastrophy for the unique region of Bearusian Plesye as well as the natural territories of Poland and Ukraine."

tabs-2/paragraphs-0/text,"Pripyat is one of the most biggest undamaged  rivers in Europe. This is the only Belarusian river that flows in east direction, which defines its unique ecosystem. In the river's flood plain 1.5 mln birds recharge during migrations. And on the whole over 90% of total number of birds in Belarus are recorded to inhabit Polesye. E40 waterway will have its impact on the most valuable natural territory in Belarus: Pripyatsky national park, Polesye Radiation and Ecological Reserve, 11 republican and six local reservations. 12 of them are of international significance."
