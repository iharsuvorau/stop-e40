sections-0/sections-4/paragraphs-0/text,"Yes, carbon dioxide emissions reduction is supposed to be one of the advantages the project gives to the society. At the same time, there is no any kind of quantitative calculations of carbon dioxide emissions. We know from other (including our own) development that CO2 emissions associated with inland water transport are generally comparable to those from rail transport (the comparative table is presented in the material “Evaluation of the document"" Restoration of Inland Waterway E40 Dnieper-Vistula: from Strategy to Planning. Final Feasibility Study Report """
sections-0/sections-5/paragraphs-1/text,"However, I do not put a cross on water transport as such. In the circles of Polish NGOs, one can often hear such a slogan: ""You do not have to adapt the river to the ships, you have to adapt the ships to the river"". If the river allows you to transport cargo without huge investments - why not. But in the case of our rivers, which for the most part are flat, shallow and heavily meandering, large-tonnage transit traffic does not make sense. Local and tourist transportation is possible."

sections-0/sections-5/paragraphs-0/text,"Warsaw Ecological Economics Center (a unit of the University of Warsaw I work with) performed analysis for a similar project at the Oder. Colleagues came to the conclusion that the projects on the water transport development are expedient only in very specific cases. Very important for water transport is the way investment costs (one-time long-term investments) correlate with operational costs (aimed at maintaining current work). If annual operating costs are more than 1% of investment costs, then the project, as a rule, becomes unprofitable. In the case of the Oder project, this proportion was 3-5%. In continental Europe with severe winters and the navigation period limited to several months, such projects are likely to be systematically uncompetitive."
sections-0/sections-0/paragraphs-1/text,"The main claim to this report is the methodological mistakes made in its development. The document was announced as an analysis of the benefits and costs on the E40 waterway restoration project - this kind of evaluation should be consistent with the neoclassical theory of the public welfare economy. However, the report did not take into account the huge investment costs - about 12 billion euros. From our point of view, this in fact disqualifies the report."

sections-0/sections-2/paragraphs-1/text,"Notably, in the case of the Middle Bug, the authors of the document considered that the presence of protected natural areas there is an argument for not to transform the river bed and coastal ecosystems, but to build a bypass channel. However, in the Vistula lower reaches the problem is absolutely analogous, not to mention the five dozen protected areas on the territory of Belarus and Ukraine, which were not included in the document at all."
sections-0/sections-4/title,One of the E40 project developers’ main arguments is the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere during the transportation of goods on water. What is said about this in the feasibility study?
sections-0/sections-6/paragraphs-1/text,"Developers of the project E40, in my opinion, have mixed up the purpose and means. The document ""Restoration of the E-40 main waterway on the Dnieper-Vistula section: from strategy to planning"" has a quote, which, from my point of view, conveys well the philosophy of developers. It reads as follows: “...Waterways presented in the report are analysed in the model from optimistic viewpoint because they may seem to be the main ways geographically, while in practice shipping may be difficult or simply impossible (as in the case of E40). However, after serious recent investments in road, rail and air infrastructure, it is time to draw attention to the waterways...” <em>["" Waterways presented in the report are analysed in the model from optimistic viewpoint because they may seem to be the main ways geographically, while in practice shipping may be difficult or simply impossible (as in the case of E40).

sections-0/sections-1/paragraphs-0/text,"When it comes to such large-scale projects as the E40, in order to understand whether it is beneficial for society, you need to fully estimate all the benefits and all the costs that arise as a result of its implementation. The external costs, that is, the costs that third parties have against their will while implementing the project must be also taken into account. In the existing document they are not by and large taken into account. And the developers claim that these costs cannot be estimated - but this is not true, in modern theory and practice of economy there are ways to assess them. If the benefits exceed the costs, then we can say that the project is useful for society and increases its welfare. This may be an argument for the object to be financed from public sources."

sections-0/sections-2/paragraphs-0/text,"Both these elements are located on the territory of Poland. The first element is a bypass channel that would connect the Vistula and Mukhavets: the developers considered that it would be inappropriate to use the Medium Bug for the E40, since there are protected areas of the Natura 2000 network. The second element is the valley and bed of the Lower Vistula. It is a rather shallow river, which is preserved in the almost natural state, and corresponds to <a href='https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9A%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%84%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B5%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%85_%D0%B2%D0%BD%D1%83%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%85_%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BD%D1%8B%D1%85_%D0%BF%D1%83%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%B9'>the second class of navigability</a> while for river-sea vessels a minimum of the fourth class is required. All the other elements of the E40 route on the territory of Belarus and Ukraine were not included in the analysis of benefits and costs. The document sets out the approximate amount of necessary investment, but they are completely unfounded."
sections-0/sections-6/paragraphs-0/text,"They are absolutely different rivers. The Rhine was heavily transformed 150 years ago, when there was no other logistical alternative. Now there is a developed railway network, a network of highways and air routes, the pipeline that has an important place in the transport system of Belarus. And the Danube is a deep-water river, which flows in a serious tectonic fault, this is also an unsuitable example. It must be understood that transport is a means, not an end in itself. If we have a need to transport cargo or passengers from point A to point B, this can be done in different ways. For this, it is not necessary to invest billions in the destruction of the undisturbed nature."
lead,"""The report did not take into account the huge investment costs - about 12 billion euros."" The economist Svyatoslav Volyusuk together with his colleague Mikhail Tchaikovsky have conducted an analysis of the feasibility study of the E40 waterway restoration project and found a number of serious omissions that do not allow considering the feasibility study as an argument in favor of the project."
sections-0/sections-1/paragraphs-1/text,"However, according to the existing documents for the E40 project, the majority of benefits, which consists in reducing the shipping cost, will be in the hands of carriers - usually private companies. While the taxpayers bear the burden of project financing. Even if some uncertain oligarchs completely and gratuitously finance the E40 construction, this claim may be less acute, but it still remains - after all, if the project is implemented, we will get huge external costs associated with river ecosystems degradation, hydrological regime change and other irreversible changes in the environment."
sections-0/sections-3/paragraphs-0/text,"It can be concluded from the text that all the freight flows planning calculations were carried out on the basis of the model developed for the Netherlands. The disadvantage of the text is understatement, but at least from one fragment of the document such a conclusion can be drawn. As we understood, this forecast was made earlier within the framework of two international projects, in which the developers of the feasibility study took part. How well this model was adjusted at least to the conditions of Poland is difficult to say, there is no direct indication in the text. In any case, such a model is a ""black box"", because all calculations are done by a computer program. The report does not directly set out the assumptions and preconditions on which the calculations are based."
