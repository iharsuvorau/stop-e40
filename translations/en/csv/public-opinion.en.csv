sections-0/sections-0/paragraphs-0/text,"For me the E40 project is similar to a project on turning northern rivers to southern deserts: dividents to a small group of developers and builders and irreversible consequences for the nature of Polesye will take place. Some of the local inhabitants will get jobs at the E40 but most will suffer from the artificial changes in the ecosystems in the region. Polesye is a territory of global significance, thus we can protect it only by coming together: ecologists, inhabitants of Polesye (poleshuki), tourists, fishermen, hunters and other social groups'"

sections-1/sections-0/paragraphs-1/text,For years we have been watching the project developing. Since 2015 it has been constantly discussed in Mass Media and worried a lot of environment protection experts. Our organisation was initially scepticc to this idea. Several years we have been covering the topic on the E40 construction negative impact on our sites hoping that these plans won't be taken for serious by those who take such decisions. At the beginning of 2017 we saw that the initiators of the project are actively searching for investment in the development of EIA and understood that it was time to act.

sections-1/sections-1/paragraphs-1/text," At the moment we are consolidating our powers with an international environmental association. We want to attract attention of governments of the three counties and of European Parliament to this issue as well as to demonstrate that any decisions on the project should be made with the active participation of public and independent experts. This is a cross-border project, consequently it is subject to <a href='/#/ru/articles/law'>international conventions</a> (Espoo, Aarhus Convention) according to which the  Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) should be conducted in a single package in all the three countries and should be regulated by the rules of the EU Directive - with involving the public at every stage and with appropriate consultations with independent experts."
lead,Though active development of the idea of the E40 waterway construction has been conducted since 2014 few people have heard of it. Why all of a sudden Belarusian environmental organisations have decided to launch Stop E40 public campaign? What do thay want? And what local inhabitants and relevant State authorities themselves have heard of it if they have heard of it at all?

sections-1/sections-0/paragraphs-0/text,"The high-scale project E40 may change the Polesye we know to the worse. The waterway will affect a network of important natural territories of national and international significance. Polesye of Pripyat is a huge water reservoir (the width of its flood is up to 30km) with its unique flood plain landscape: It is meanders of the river, numerous old channels, bayou lakes and coves that form the original ecosystems of this region as well as rare flood plain oak groves (so-called dubravy), dunes, the biggest wetlands and naturally shaped wet meadow coverages."

sections-1/sections-1/paragraphs-0/text,"In March, 2017 we created a working group consisting of a number of experts and organisations for independent estimation of the E40 impact on the envirinment and economics of the region. During the work we saw that most of the inhabitants of Polesye had never heard of the high-scale plans to construct a waterway in their region. For several months we studied the information on the project in detail, undertook a census of birds, undertook expeditions to the places, made assessments of economic efficiency of the project, analysed and identifyed the potential environmental dangers, informed governmental establishments and admministrations of protected natural areas through which the E40 will be laid and whose opinion hadn't been yet considered. As a result the Stop E40 public campaign and the press conference «<a href='/#/ru/pages/press-kit'>Stop Е40! Economical and environmental outcomes of a new waterway construction</a>» were launched and took place on July 19, 2017 in Minsk. During the campaign independent experts explained their point of view on this project."
