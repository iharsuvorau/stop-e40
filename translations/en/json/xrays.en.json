Strontium, cesium and transuranium were mostly deposited in the contaminated areas. But now a new problem has arisen: plutonium-241 in the decay process turns into americium-241, whose distribution has not been sufficiently studied at the moment. The behavior of the same plutonium-241 and -239 is known, because nuclear weapons tests were conducted and the consequences of Hiroshima and Nagasaki explosions were studied. There is not enough information about americium-241 and its behavior cannot be predicted."}],"title":"Which Belarusian authorities should monitor the areas contaminated by radiation?

If silt is not touched, there is no particular danger, because in general the river is clean due to the constant flow. The threat is that during dredging works, the silt can be \"disturbed\" and can go downstream the Pripyat and Dnieper to the Kiev reservoir, while about 30 million Ukrainians receive water from it and related reservoirs. In Belarus the most dangerous areas are in the Polesye Radiation Reserve, where not many people live, but the threat still remains."},{"text":"It is interesting that the existing documents on the E40 waterway restoration make only brief reference to the fact that it will pass through unsafe areas with deposits of radionuclides. In my opinion, much of the rationale must focus on the radiological component. In general, it is strange to see this project. When I was the responsible secretary of the USSR Supreme Soviet Commission to overcome the Chernobyl disaster consequences, we controlled the expert group who developed the concept of safe living in these regions. These lands were deleted from all economic activity plans for many years, there was no question of digging, plowing and growing there."}],"quote":{"text":"\"When conducting dredging works, silt can go downstream the Pripyat and Dnieper to the Kiev reservoir, and about 30 million Ukrainians receive water from it and related reservoirs\""},"title":"It is assumed that a lot of radionuclides accumulate in the silt, and if it is \"disturbed\", recontamination can occur.

In 2011, there was a similar story with a change in its size, then they wanted to take away part of the territory and use it for economic purposes. A commission consisting of different institutions representatives was created, and they made an unambiguous conclusion: it is dangerous to use this land. Even on conditionally clean territories there are radiation specks. The Polesye Reserve reminds a mosaic: it does not have large areas free from radiation. So the established boundaries of the reserve should not be changed - this is the expert commission official conclusion, and the radiation background has not changed for six years.

That is why it is necessary to install a very long dam to block it, moreover, such a construction will cause overflowing of the river and flooding of huge territories.

It will involve grass and turf, which since the Chernobyl accident is rarely washed by water, so they store radiation in large quantities, much higher than normal.

There is no fairway for 30 years, as disturbing the bottom sediments, we will inevitably send the contaminated silt to Kiev.
