Even if we don't take into account maintenance and repair costs, it is possible to recover the money initially invested only after a hundred years' time period, which does not a conventionally accepted payback period at all. But at the same time, the road provided convenient transport, more efficient and cheap delivery of goods from certain regions. This in its turn contributed to the establishment of new manufacturing departments and gross regional product growth (GRP). On condition, in five years period GRP grew by 200 million dollars. Thus, we have an indirect multiplicated effect expressed in economic growth increase in the region, at the same time the growth has significantly exceeded infrastructure development expenses.

Business Union of Entrepreneurs and Employers (BUEE) estimates that in case of a successful 'overload' implementation the Belarusian railway revenues can be reduced by approximately 250 million dollars with the earnings of road transport companies reduced by 80 million dollars per year. At the same time, rail and road transport sectors are crucial to Belarusian economy: hundreds of thousands of job places have been created there, the industry flourishes without breaking market law and with minimum of budgetary subsidies. Even minor relative reduction in jobs in these sectors, caused by a sharp decrease in the earnings of companies, can even any increase in the productivity of water transport.

In the 22nd century rivers are valuable as natural sites playing an important role in regions hydrology, where biodiversity is concentrated.

And that's what E40 advocates do at different conferences: they present the project as 'Vistula—Dnieper canal'.

При этом сектора железнодорожных и&nbsp;автомобильных перевозок критически важны для белорусской экономики: там созданы сотни тысяч рабочих мест, отрасли работают прибыльно, по&nbsp;рыночным законам, с&nbsp;минимальной поддержкой в&nbsp;виде бюджетных субсидий.

К&nbsp;слову, уже сегодня весь белорусский участок Е40&nbsp;судоходен, по&nbsp;нему могут перемещаться баржи грузоподъёмностью до&nbsp;1&nbsp;тысячи тонн. Это эквивалент железнодорожного состава.

Such transportation was already carried out in the 1990s, but as a result, they were abandoned for being uneconomical. Belarusian potash fertilizers are largely exported to the remote markets of Southeast Asia and South America. Even if we assume that their delivery from the Belarusian-Ukrainian border will be organized by river-sea vessels, which will exclude overloading in the Black Sea ports, such vessels in case of long-distance transport will lose to large sea dry cargo vessels, which are currently loaded with potash fertilizers in the Baltic seaports with already well-established logistics.

"},{text:'These lands are designed to preserve (sustainable development of) the totality of natural and man-made ecosystems in accordance with international and national environmental laws. The greatest number of protected communities and objects of high international protection status as well as their area are concentrated in the floodplain zone. The category of protected communities 3210 "Habitats Directive" (92/43/EEC) includes the Communities of riverbeds (in the natural state) (Fennoscandian natural rivers).

The Polesky Flyway is the largest in Eastern Europe, its central axis is the Pripyat floodplain.

River silt accumulates a huge amount of radionuclides. Violation of radioactive sands that are conserved at the Kiev reservoir bottom will pose a threat to the safety of drinking water supply to one-fourth of Ukraine's population, and will also create conditions for possible radioactive contamination of the capital of Ukraine – Kiev. "},{text:"At the same time, the E40 waterway is the so-called Central invasive corridor, through which invasion of Ponto-Caspian alien aquatic organisms into European water bodies occurs. The most important (and first) link in this corridor is the Dnieper-Bug Canal, located on the territory of Belarus, which connects the Black and Baltic Sea basins. The creation (reconstruction) of navigable canals and locks for vessel passage along the Belarusian E40 track section will contribute to the penetration and further spread of alien Ponto-Caspian aquatic organisms both to the territory of Poland and other Western European countries.

The project feasibility study indicates that in the foreseeable future the capital costs for the E40 construction will not be covered. We can only expect to cover current costs for fleet operations and infrastructure maintenance, provided that it will be possible to reach regular volumes of transportation of more than 6 million tons of cargo per year. "},{text:"On the basis of the factors, only a short-term economic effect is guaranteed for the period of investment development and contracted work on the E40 infrastructure. In the medium and long term, the effect of this investment project can be zero or even negative. Such prospects do not correspond to the sustainable development principles, which should be based on the infrastructure projects. Water transport due to low competitiveness is the most subsidized industry per unit of cargo. "},{text:"The promised economic effect of creating jobs in water transport and its infrastructure will be offset by the possible job reduction in the sectors of road and rail transport and the deterioration in the economic performance of carrier companies. Losses of automobile carriers can make about 80 million dollars a year.
